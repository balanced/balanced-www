2. **Required Information:** For you to sell and receive payments on Marketplace, Balanced is required to validate your identity with Third Party Service Providers. No hard credit check (any credit check that might impact your credit score negatively) is run, however you will, at minimum, be asked for the following information:
    + Full legal name

    + Business phone

    For this purpose, Marketplace may also provide any other relevant information that it has obtained from you.

    By accepting this agreement you authorize Balanced to share, retrieve and verify information about you through properly vetted Third Party Service Providers to the extent required to provide payment services to you. You acknowledge that this may include history of past addresses and other data about you. We may require that your information be updated from time to time.

     *Note:* In rare cases, the above information may not be enough to verify you. In these instances, Marketplace may approach and request more information possibly including EIN and/or Tax ID. Failure to provide this information may result in suspension or termination of your Marketplace sales and account

3. **Privacy Policy:** You agree to Balanced’s privacy policy (available at [https://www.balancedpayments.com/privacy](https://www.balancedpayments.com/privacy)) and it is incorporated by reference into this seller agreement as if it were set forth here in its entirety.

    Any personal or payment information acquired during the course of Balanced handling your payments shall be handled with due care and used only according to the terms set forth in Balanced's Privacy Policy.

4. **Authorization:** By entering your payment information and selling through Marketplace you authorize Balanced to credit your bank account for sales made and debit your bank account for any necessary adjustments.

    You further authorize us to hold, receive, and disburse funds according to payment instructions as provided to us by Marketplace on your behalf.

5. **Funds Held for the Benefit of Seller:** Buyer funds received on behalf of Marketplace or Marketplace's Buyers which will be co-mingled and held with funds belonging to other users in one or more For Benefit Of (FBO) accounts at Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (or such successor bank as Balanced may determine) on Marketplace's or seller's behalf and for the benefit of Marketplace's sellers (each a "Pooled Account"). Balanced maintains a ledger that properly delineates the seller for whom the funds are earmarked.

    Balanced has sole discretion over the establishment and maintenance of any Pooled Account. Balanced will hold such funds separate from Balanced’s corporate funds and will not use said funds for our corporate purposes, will not make these funds available to our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or for any other purpose, and will not knowingly permit our creditors to seize said funds.

It may also applies should Balanced’s bank partner otherwise require the Commercial Entity Agreement.

    This does not change any transaction arrangements, fees, or fulfillment structures between you, Balanced, and Marketplace.

### Appendix A
**COMMERCIAL ENTITY AGREEMENT**

In connection with your Seller Agreement with Balanced, Inc. (“Provider”), Vantiv and its designated Member Bank and Wells Fargo Merchant Services and its designated Member Bank (collectively “Acquirers”) will provide you (“Sub-merchant”) with certain payment processing services (“Services”) in accordance with the terms of this Commercial Entity Agreement.

In consideration of Sub-merchant’s receipt of credit or debit card funded payments, and participation in programs affiliated with MasterCard International Inc. ("MasterCard"), VISA U.S.A. Inc. ("VISA"), Discover (“Discover”), and certain similar entities (collectively, “Associations), Sub-merchant is required to (i) enter into a direct relationship with an entity that is a member of the Associations and (ii) agree to comply with Association rules as they pertain to applicable credit and debit card payments. By executing this Commercial Entity Agreement, Sub-merchant is fulfilling the Association rule of entering into a direct relationship with a Member of the Associations; however, Acquirers understand that Sub-merchant may have contracted with Provider to obtain certain processing services and that Provider may have agreed to be responsible to Sub-merchant for all or part of Merchant’s obligations contained herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals and of the mutual promises contained herein as well as by clicking-through and continuing to use Provider’s services, the parties agree as follows:

**1. Certain Merchant Responsibilities**

Sub-merchant agrees to participate, and to cause third parties acting as Sub-merchant’s agent (“Agents”), to participate, in the Associations in compliance with, and subject to, the by-laws, operating regulations and/or all other rules, policies and procedures of the Associations (collectively "Operating Regulations").

Without limiting the foregoing, Sub-merchant agrees that it will fully comply with any and all confidentiality and security requirements of the USA Patriot Act (or similar law, rule or regulation), VISA, MasterCard, Discover, and/or Other Networks, including but not limited to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, the VISA Cardholder Information Security Program, the MasterCard Site Data Protection Program, and any other program or requirement that may be published and/or mandated by the Associations. For purposes of this section, Agents include, but are not limited to, Sub-merchant’s software providers and/or equipment providers.

If appropriately indicated in Sub-merchant’s agreement with Provider, Sub-merchant may be a limited-acceptance merchant, which means that Sub- merchant has elected to accept only certain Visa and MasterCard card types (i.e., consumer credit, consumer debit, and commercial cards) and must display appropriate signage to indicate the same. Acquirers have no obligation other than those expressly provided under the Operating Regulations and applicable law as they may relate to limited acceptance. Sub-merchant, and not Acquirer, will be solely responsible for the implementation of its decision for limited acceptance, including but not limited to policing the card type(s) accepted at the point of sale.

Sub-merchant shall only complete sales transactions produced as the direct result of bona fide sales made by Sub-merchant to cardholders, and is expressly prohibited from processing, factoring, laundering, offering, and/or presenting sales transactions which are produced as a result of sales made by any person or entity other than Merchant, or for purposes related to financing terrorist activities.

Sub-merchant may set a minimum transaction amount to accept a card that provides access to a credit account, under the following conditions: i) the minimum transaction amount does not differentiate between card issuers; ii) the minimum transaction amount does not differentiate between MasterCard, Visa, or any other acceptance brand; and iii) the minimum transaction amount does not exceed ten dollars (or any higher amount established by the Federal Reserve).

**2. Merchant Prohibitions**

Sub-merchant must not i) require a cardholder to complete a postcard or similar device that includes the cardholder’s account number, card expiration date, signature, or any other card account data in plain view when mailed, ii) add any tax to transactions, unless applicable law expressly requires that a Sub- merchant impose a tax (any tax amount, if allowed, must be included in the transaction amount and not collected separately), iii) request or use an account number for any purpose other than as payment for its goods or services, iv) disburse funds in the form of travelers checks if the sole purpose is to allow the cardholder to make a cash purchase of goods or services from Sub-merchant, v) disburse funds in the form of cash unless Sub-merchant is dispensing funds in the form of travelers checks, TravelMoney cards, or foreign currency (in such case, the transaction amount is limited to the value of the travelers checks, TravelMoney cards, or foreign currency, plus any commission or fee charged by the Sub-merchant), or Sub-merchant is participating in a cash back service, vi) submit any transaction receipt for a transaction that was previously charged back to the acquirers and subsequently returned to Sub-merchant, irrespective of cardholder approval, vii) accept a Visa consumer credit card or commercial Visa product issued by a U.S. issuer to collect or refinance an existing debt, viii) accept a card to collect or refinance an existing debit that has been deemed uncollectable by Sub-merchant, or ix) submit a transaction that represents collection of a dishonored check. Sub-merchant further agrees that, under no circumstance, will Sub-merchant store cardholder data in violation of the Laws or the Operating Regulations including but not limited to the storage of track-2 data. Neither Sub-merchant nor its Agent shall retain or store magnetic-stripe data subsequent to the authorization of a sales transaction.

**3. Settlement**

Upon receipt of Sub-merchant’s sales data for card transactions through Provider Services, Acquirers will process Sub-merchant’s sales data to facilitate the funds transfer between the various Associations and Sub-merchant. After Acquirer receives credit for such sales data, Acquirer will fund Sub-merchant, either directly to the Sub-merchant-Owned Designated Account or through Provider to an account designated by Provider (“Provider Designated Account”), at Acquirers’ sole option, for such card transactions. Sub-merchant agrees that the deposit of funds to the Provider Designated Account shall discharge Acquirers of their settlement obligation to Sub-merchant, and that any dispute regarding the receipt or amount of settlement shall be between Provider and Merchant. Acquirers will debit the Provider Designated Account for funds owed to Acquirers as a result of the Services provided hereunder, unless a Sub-merchant-owned account is otherwise designated below. Further, if a cardholder disputes a transaction, if a transaction is charged back for any reason, or if Acquirers reasonably believe a transaction is unauthorized or otherwise unacceptable, the amount of such transaction may be charged back and debited from Merchant or Provider.

**4. Term and Termination**

Acquirers shall bear no liability and have no obligations to correct any errors resulting from Sub- merchant’s failure to comply with the duties and obligations of the preceding sentence.
