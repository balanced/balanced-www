        #### Decide when to disburse funds
        Once a card is charged, funds are implicitly placed in
        escrow for as long as you need. You decide when to
        pay your merchants upon fulfillment of an order or
        a service.

        [More about escrow](/docs/overview?language=bash#escrow)

        #### Define your own fee structure
        Set your own fees by determining how much to collect
        from buyers, merchants, or both.
